This code generates RSA key pairs from randomly chosen prime numbers of different bit lengths, encrypts and decrypts randomly created integer messages with those keys, and then attempts to break the encryption using a brute-force factorization attack by finding the prime factors of n. It measures the time required for the factorization process and visualizes how the brute-force attack time increases with larger bit sizes on a plot.
