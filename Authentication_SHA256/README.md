This project demonstrates authenticating a student’s assignment submission using RSA, SHA-256 hashing, and asymmetric padding: the algorithm generates an RSA key pair for the student, encrypts and decrypts the student’s unique ID, combines it with the assignment, computes a SHA-256 hash of the combined data, and signs the hash with the student’s private key; the instructor then verifies the signature with the student’s public key, ensuring both the authenticity of the student’s identity and the integrity of the submitted assignment.
